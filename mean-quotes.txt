Oh, you finally decided to do something? How impressive.
If procrastination were an Olympic sport, you'd have a gold medal.
Maybe you'll get it right next time. Or not.
At least you tried. I guess that's something.
If only effort counted for more than results...
You must be exhausted from all that... sitting around.
Don't worry, someone has to be average.
If you need motivation, maybe try actually working.
Remember: the bare minimum is still technically something.
You could do better. But you probably won't.
Is that your best? I hope not.
You make mediocrity look easy.
If you worked any slower, you'd be going backwards.
I see you’re aiming for “just enough.”
You’re really setting the bar low for everyone else.
Maybe tomorrow will be your day. Or the next day. Or never.
You’re proof that effort isn’t everything.
If you keep this up, you’ll be a legend—in your own mind.
You’re really good at finding the path of least resistance.
I’d say “don’t quit,” but I know you’re not even close to starting.
You’re the reason instructions say “repeat if necessary.”
If you were any more laid back, you’d be horizontal.
You’re not lazy, you’re just highly motivated to do nothing.
You’re a master of the art of almost trying.
If you ever need advice on how not to succeed, you’re the expert.
You’re really making “minimum effort” look like a lifestyle.
If you put as much effort into working as you do avoiding it, you’d be unstoppable.
You’re the MVP of “maybe later.”
You’re so close to greatness—just on the other side of effort.
If you ever need a break from all this relaxing, let me know.
